# French Museum API

## Create a new React / React Native Application

The application should have a main view allowing a user to search for museums given:

-   its name
-   its category
-   its location

The application should have a second view displaying the results of a search splitting the page in two parts:

-   a list of results
-   a map showing markers on museum location

On this second view, the user can launch a new query

(Optional) The application should have a third view displaying the details of a museum
